# Minecraft Telegram Bot
## Description:

Manage multiple Minecraft servers from Telgram.

## To do:

- fix bad log dir creation. Should throw the logging in a "try:" 
- fix serverKb so that following actions only get triggered after input received
- create propKB for propSet_command
- clean up the process to identify active servers and gather server selection/entry by user
